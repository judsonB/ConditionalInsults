# ConditionalInsults
Shakespearean Insult Generator

This program generates 3 random numbers which access a single word from 3 different lists, which when combined creates a shakespearean Insult.

There are several lists of Shakespearean Insults (there's even a flipbook out there! https://www.amazon.com/Shakespeare-Insult-Generator-Match-Insults/dp/1452127751), but Christian Heilmann's website (https://christianheilmann.com/2020/08/19/fun-project-shakespeare-insult-generator/) holds the same first list I was introduced to.
